# 2D-Random-Flyer
A drone begins flying aimlessly beginning at the origin, (0,0). At each time step, the drone flies one meter in a random direction—either north, south, east, or west—with equal probability. 

Program takes an integer argument n, representing the number of time steps, and prints the following:
For each step, the location of the drone, including the starting point (0,0).  
At the end, the final Euclidean distance (straight, "as the crow flies") from the origin."
a sample output, with input of n=4:
(0,0)
(0,1)
(0,2)
(-1,2)
(-1,3)
euclidean distance: 3.1622776
